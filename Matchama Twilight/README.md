Original theme from: https://gitlab.com/cscs/matchama-kde

Changes i've made:
*Remove green frame on some focused elemets
*Use Twiligth icons for Plasma theme (https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Twilight-kde)
*Use busy widget from Adapta (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/adapta-kde)
*Use checkbox widget from Materia (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde)
*Set progress bars height to 5px (make them smaller)
*Try to fix window decorations to make them compatible with newer Plasma versions (still wip)
